# How to read my CFB Prediction Model Project

## This is a group project that was made by Me, Noah Gscheidmeier, Calvin Dejong, Sanskaar Mathur, and Dhimaan Bhattacharya. I and Noah worked on the Data Analysis and creating our Final Dataset, while Calvin and Sanskaar developed the prediction model before we all came together to refine it. The Research Document provided in this repository partially uses data visualizations created by them and myself, but the text in the document was written by me.

### **NCAAFootballGraphs.Rmd:** The R Markdown File where our Data Visualizations are stored.

### **NCAAFootballGraphs.html:** The html file where our Data Visualizations are stored, which can easily be opened locally in most browsers.

### **big_ten_teams_data.csv:** Our original un-polished dataset that we got from Kaggle.

### **final_big_ten_teams_data.csv:** Our polished dataset that we used in our visualizations.

### NCAAFootball_Project_Writeup.PDF:** My Writeup on the Project that explains the steps we took and what it means for our data and model.
